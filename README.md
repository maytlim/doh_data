#### Snippet regarding the dataset used here
##### Health Facility Capacity from the DOH Data Collect
> Health facility data as of 8:00 AM is encoded and submitted daily, for bed occupancy and
> mechanical ventilator utilization as intended for Covid-19 cases, and weekly, for select
> logistics inventory, by hospitals and infirmaries through the DOH DataCollect BedTracker
> App v4.1.
> Submitted data as of 11:59PM of the previous day is extracted for analysis. The last
> observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method is being implemented to correct for
> missing values incurred by non-submission of some health facilities for the current cut-off
> date of analysis. The most recent submission in the last 14 days of each unique facility is
> extracted and analyzed. This step is necessary so that the total number of beds and equipment
> will not be affected by the daily submission rate. As of August 5, 2020, the overall response
> rates for the DOH DataCollect BedTracker App are at 98.3% for hospitals and 97.5% for
> infirmaries. Summary estimates are released on DOH Facebook and BeatCovid Situationer
> every 4pm of the current day.
